## Research Experience {#research}

**Multiple Testing Methods for Forgery Detection with Conformal Risk Control**  
Southern University of Science and Technology, Department of Statistics and Data Science  
Advisor: Assistant Professor Hongxin Wei  

- Designed multiple-testing procedures for pixel-wise and cluster-wise image forgery detection.  
- Developed FDR control methods with high-probability guarantees in conformal prediction settings.

**Subspace Diffusion and Linear Reconstruction (Ongoing)**  
University of British Columbia, Department of Mathematics  
Advisor: Associate Professor Yankai Cao; PhD student Chaojie Ji  

- Analyzed stochastic reconstruction of orthogonal components caused by subspace upsampling and its effect on stability and image fidelity.  
- Utilized local linearity and low-rank Jacobian structure of the posterior mean predictor (PMP).  
- Developed a low-rank linear operator to replace random high-dimensional reconstruction, improving stability of multi-stage subspace diffusion.
