My notes include personal annotations and additional theorems on TA's notes. "in page xx" refers to Dummit's, "CAA page xx" refers to Joseph's, otherwise refer to 抽象代数.<br>   
I think Joseph's is most suitable for beginner or self-learning, then refer to Dummit's for further theorems and properties.
