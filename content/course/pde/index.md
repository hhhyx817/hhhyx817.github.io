[midterm review](./review-midterm.pdf)
[final review](./review-final.pdf)  (really comprehensive!)
   
I think this course is more suitable for senior students with the preliminaries ODE, functional analysis(lecture 11-12, 17-18), operation(lecture 20-21), or just reciting the proof of theorem will be difficult(like me...). And you need to have a good grasp of the transformation of various gradient formulas.


## My Course Note{#my-course-note}

Due to time constraints, my notes include the key points for the exam. I did not take notes on topics that are beyond the syllabus or not emphasized. 

[Lect 2](./L2.pdf)<br>   
Simple examples on characteristic methods.(See Lect 22 for further explanation)<br>

[Lect 3](./L3.pdf)<br>   
Fourier transformation, slove homogeneous heat equation(HE) by fourier, approximate iddentity to verify<br>  

[Lect 4](./L4.pdf)<br>   
Another derivation of HE solution(scaling symmetry), nonhomogeneous heat equation(NHE), duhamel's principle and proof<br>  

[Lect 5 & 6](./L5&6.pdf)<br>    
Propertoes of eigen pair, separation of variables<br>  

[Lect 7](./L7.pdf)<br>   
Maximum principle in variable cases, L-stablity<br>   
[reference for Lect 7](./ref7.pdf)<br>   

[Lect 8](./L8.pdf)<br>   
Energy method, backward HE(existence and uniqueness of solutions using above knowledge)<br>  

[Lect 9](./L9.pdf)<br>   
Poisson's equation, green function and fundamental solution(by symmetry), <br>  
[reference for Lect 9](./ref9.pdf)<br>   
Harmonic function in details<br>  

[Lect 10]<br>   
Poisson kernel/approximate iddentity/green function and fundamental solution<br>  

[Lect 11 second half](./L11-second-half.pdf)<br>   
Harmonic lifting, subharmonic<br>  

[Lect 12 & 13](./L12&13.pdf)<br>   
Perron’s method and Green’s function, Dirichlet principle(first variation and Euler–Langrange equation), weak solution/sobolev space/weak convergence, poincare inequality<br>  
Weak solution and weak convergence is beyond syllabus but sobolev space and norm is within.<br>  

[Lect 14](./L14.pdf)<br>   
L-stability(maximum principle and relevent corolaries is similar to those in Lect 7), wave equation and solution in 1-dimension<br>  

[Lect 15](./L15.pdf)<br>   
Wave equation and solution in 2-dimension, in 3-dimension(TO BE DONE in notes)<br>  

[Lect 16]<br>  
Separation of variables<br>  
Just seeing examples in reference is enough  -- Chapter 4.2.1(from page 179) _偏微分方程_<br>  
 
[Lect 17 & 18]<br>   
Exsistence and uniqueness of week solution<br>  

[Lect 19](./L19.pdf)<br>   
Fixed point method, halmilton-jacobi equation, caculus of variation(further proof in Lect 20, we'll use hopf-lax to reformulate the problem of solving Hamilton-Jacobi PDE as an optimal control problem for dynamic program)<br>  

[Lect 20](./L20.pdf)<br>   
Legendre transform and duality, hopf-lax formula(in time dimension)<br>  
[reference for Lect 20](./ref20.pdf)<br>

This ref is not a very nice one<br>  

[Lect 21]<br>     
Hopf-lax formula(in space dimension), Beyond syllabus<br>

[Lect 22](./L22.pdf)<br>   
Examples on characteristic methods/entrophy condition/viscosity solution<br>  
[proof for Lect 22](./proof22.pdf)<br>   
Proof and examples of above mentioned topics, Beyond syllabus<br>  
This ref is really really nice!
