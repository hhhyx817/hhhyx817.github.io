In my notes, the notation "in page xx" refers to the textbook by Dummit's, notation "CAA page xx" refers to the textbook by Joseph's, otherwise refer to 抽象代数.<br>   
Joseph's is most suitable for beginner or self-learning, and I refer to Dummit's for further theorems and properties.


## My Course Note{#my-course-note}
Notes on field theory are relatively well-organized, but those on group theory have some unresolved issues and most are written in Chinese. <br>
