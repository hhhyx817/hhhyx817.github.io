## My course note{my-course-note}
Most of the previous notes for Group Theory are written in Chinese. My notes on field theory are relatively clear and well-organized. But the notes on group theory and ring theory have some unresolved issues and unclear due to handwrting and scanning. Feel free to contact me for discussions on notes and on abstract algebra.
